## 1. Go Step By Step
- Try to solve pieces of the problem one by one.
- You can create a file named {main}.rs ou any other name and test your progress in the terminal.
- You can use another file with the token `mod`.

## 2. Create a new function to solve the problem
- You don't need to use the default function to solve your problem, try to create a function that solve one of the pieces of the problem then import to the default function.
  

## 3. Try to use iterators
- In the above useful links you can learn more about iterators.
